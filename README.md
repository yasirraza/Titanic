# Titanic
Titanic Disaster -- Who survived and who did not? This project aims at developing a model that predicts the fate of each passenger on the famous RMS Titanic that met a disaster and sank in Atalntic Ocean on 15 April 1912. The objective of this project is to take part in a modelling competetion hosted on the website Kaggle as part of the learning exercise. The model is trained on the data set in the train.csv file using a subset of the given variables except survived variable which is the target variable. Once the model is developed, it will be used to predict the target variable from the data set in test.csv file and submit the resultant predictions to Kaggle in the format as provided in the gender_submission.csv file.
